Window API in Spark SQL
Spark introduced window API in 1.4 version to support smarter grouping functionalities. 
They are very useful for people coming from SQL background. One of the missing window API was ability to create windows using time. Time plays an important role in many industries like finance, telecommunication where understanding the data depending upon the time becomes crucial.

In Spark 2.0, framework has introduced built in support for time windows. These behave very similar to time windows in spark-streaming.
